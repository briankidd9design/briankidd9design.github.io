			<h1>Investor Information</h1>
			<h2>Mark Kembel - CEO & Founder</h2>
			
			<p>Mark Kembel is a Microsoft alumni searching for accredited investors (millionaires or people making $200K per year) that are interested in helping 
			getting a new technology company started. We are looking for $500k to start with and will do a special IPO after that for $2 million where anyone can 
			invest.  For those people who get in with the first offering they will get a low price on the stock. I plan to build the business up and sell it to a 
			national employment agency in four years. I had a lot of interest for my last training business with several agencies. </p>
			
			<p> My resume and references are on LinkedIn under Mark Kembel. I foresee a big demand for programmers and other tech positions in the future.  
			I have 7 years experience in the technology training business and have trained hundreds of software testers for the Volt Microsoft account. It is an 
			national online training center that uses courseware designed by Microsoft Certified Trainers. Our online program allows us to train and test students 
			skills over the internet. Included in the plan is a national job placement agency for the students.  </p>

			<h1>Strategy</h1>
			<h2>Why Software Engineering Plus? </h2> 
			
			<p>There are three main reasons why there is currently a shortage of programmers.  Software Engineering Plus, SEP has identified these areas and has 
			added them to their business plan. </p>
			
			<p>The first is finding the person that is suited for being a programmer.  SEP focuses on where these people go to learn.  SEP will partner with the 
			library system to provide a free Intro to C# that students can check out for two months period. We will provide the online instructor as part of the 
			process. At the end of their class we give them an online test to see if they are good candidates for more programming training.  Inside each library 
			copy of the course will be an ad for the rest of our online courses. </p>
			
			<p>The second is finding a larger group of individuals as prospects.  SEP will partner with Community Colleges. In the past I’ve found that colleges do an 
			excellent job filling their programming classes. SEP will provide ad materials to the colleges to print in their catalogs. This has worked in the past 
			with Mark’s other college partners. Each Software Testing course in the past always sold out and produced some of his best placements for contract jobs 
			at Microsoft. </p>
			
			<p>The last problem to getting good programming candidates is the cost of the education.  SEP prices are way lower than all the boot camp’s pricing.  
			The boot camp’s classes use different computer hardware then IBM clones and their programming languages are not the popular compared to Microsoft’s 
			languages. </p>
			
			<p>SEP online courses are developed so the student can study for getting their MCP from Microsoft testing. We plan to hire Microsoft Certified Trainers
			to develop and do the recordings for our online software.  We plan to use Ispring Solutions software for the courses, online testing and also their online 
			registration and credit card processing thru PayPal.  90% of Mark’s students in his last company used credit cards to pay for their courses at InterTest.com.  
			We will also provide a finance company for students who take more than one class or more.  The Intro to C# is discounted at $450 so the students can get a 
			good idea that their skills are good enough to take more courses. Boot Camps charge you for the whole price upfront which can be $13K or more.</p>
			
			<p>SEP plans to also place these students and create a special group of talent so that they come back for more education and also network with us for future jobs. </p>
